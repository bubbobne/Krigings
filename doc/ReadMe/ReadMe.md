## Description

The Krigings project is designed to perform spatial interpolation using kriging methods.
The implementation includes the following components:

  *  Variogram modeling: Supports multiple types of variograms (e.g., spherical, exponential, Gaussian).
  *  Ordinary kriging (OK) and Detrended Kriging for interpolation.
  *  Cross-validation module: Evaluates model accuracy through leave-one-out cross-validation.
  *  Input/Output: Reads input data from shapefile and csv and outputs results as CSV/GeoTIFF.

The project is developed using Java and built with Gradle to ensure modularity and flexibility.

First version from [@Formetta2014-zn] and [@Bancheri2018-x]

A built version of the lates release is available at the [GitHub release section](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/Krigings/releases).


## Repository and Compatibility

* The project can be imported into Eclipse.
* It is available on GitHub and can be cloned or downloaded from: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/Krigings.git)
* Travis CI is set up for automated builds and testing, running on every commit but only deploying the JAR file when a tagged release is pushed to GitHub.
* The project uses Java ?? (Oracle JDK ??) for compatibility.


## Developers' documentation
This project is a **Gradle-based Java project**.

### Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command in the working directory:

    ~ $ gradle build

in the working directory. You will find the built `.jar` in `build/libs`.
Once the build process is complete, the generated `.jar` file will be located in the `build/libs` directory.

### Building the ReadMe File

To convert the ReadMe file from Markdown (`.md`) to RestructuredText (`.rst`), run:

    pandoc doc/ReadMe/ReadMe.md -o ReadMe.rst --bibliography=doc/ReadMe/biblio.bib

This command ensures proper formatting and inclusion of references from the `biblio.bib` file.
