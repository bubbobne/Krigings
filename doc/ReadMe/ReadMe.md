## Description

The **Krigings** project is designed to perform spatial interpolation using kriging methods.
The implementation includes the following components:

  *  Variogram modeling: Supports multiple types of variograms (e.g., spherical, exponential, Gaussian).
  *  Ordinary kriging (OK) and Detrended Kriging for interpolation.
  *  Cross-validation module: Evaluates model accuracy through leave-one-out cross-validation.
  *  Input/Output: Reads input data from shapefile and csv and outputs results as CSV/GeoTIFF.

The project is developed using **Java** and built with **Gradle** to ensure modularity and flexibility.

First version from [@Formetta2014-zn] and [@Bancheri2018-x]

A ***built version of the lates release*** is available at the [ GitHub release section](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/Krigings/releases).


## Repository and Compatibility

* The project can be imported into *Eclipse*.
* It is available on GitHub and can be cloned or downloaded from: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/Krigings.git)
* **Travis CI** is set up for automated builds and testing, running on every commit but only deploying the JAR file when a tagged release is pushed to GitHub.
* The project uses Java ?? (Oracle JDK ??) for compatibility.


## Developers' documentation

This project is a Gradle-based Java project.

### Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command in the working directory:

    ~ $ gradle build

in the working directory. You will find the built `.jar` in `build/libs`.
Once the build process is complete, the generated `.jar` file will be located in the `build/libs` directory.

### Building the ReadMe File

To convert the ReadMe file from Markdown (`.md`) to RestructuredText (`.rst`), run:

    pandoc doc/ReadMe/ReadMe.md -o ReadMe.rst --bibliography=doc/ReadMe/biblio.bib

This command ensures proper formatting and inclusion of references from the `biblio.bib` file.



### Package Structure

---

#### `org.geoframe.blogpost.kriging.variogram`
**Description:** Implements variogram modeling, both experimental and theoretical.


###### `org.geoframe.blogpost.kriging.variogram.experimental`
- `ExperimentalVariogram.java` → Computes the experimental variogram from data.

###### `org.geoframe.blogpost.kriging.variogram.theoretical.curvefitter`

**Supported theoretical variogram models:**
- `Bessel.java`
- `Circular.java`
- `Exponential.java`
- `Gaussian.java`
- `Spherical.java`

#### `org.geoframe.blogpost.kriging.utilities`
**Description:** Utility functions and helper classes for kriging computations, including logarithmic transformation and the extraction of coordinates from a feature collection.

**Note**: This module might be restructured. The logarithmic transformation could be moved to a separate module to run before and after (see [issue #4](https://github.com/bubbobne/Krigings/issues/4)).
Additionally, getCoordinate might be better placed in a different class.

## Linkers' documentation

Integration with OMS3/GEOFrame:

    * The project is structured to be compatible with **GEOFrame/OMS3** models.
    * Input data can be retrieved from existing hydrological simulations for further processing.


## Users' documentation

(To be completed, it will be published on a Notion static page or on the blog.)

## Under Development

### PArallelization

A parallelization method is now under test. If the flag ***parallelComputation*** is set to true, a method that uses **ParallelStream** is employed. 

**Note**: This can be useful if you have a large number of points/maps and are not using tree parallelization.

##  Future Improvements
